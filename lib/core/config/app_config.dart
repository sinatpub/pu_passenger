/// F-07 (docs/12) — every value this app takes from the build environment,
/// in one place.
///
/// Before this, `String.fromEnvironment` calls were spread across
/// `core/utils/app_constant.dart`, `core/network_config/telegram.dart` and
/// `core/utils/debug_auth_bypass.dart`, so there was no single answer to
/// "what does this build need to be given?" — you had to grep for it.
///
/// The flavor scaffolding half of F-07 (`productFlavors`, per-environment
/// bundle ids) is **not** here: it is blocked on Q-12 (does a staging backend
/// exist) and Q-13 (does this tree build the shipped store binaries). This is
/// the half that does not depend on either answer.
///
/// ## Why the validation below exists
///
/// `String.fromEnvironment('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY')` has no default, so a build
/// that forgets `--dart-define-from-file=dart_defines.json` does not fail —
/// it compiles, installs, launches, and *then* fails every Maps and Places
/// call at runtime with an empty key. That is a slow, confusing failure a
/// long way from its cause. [missingRequiredKeys] turns it into a check the
/// app can run at startup.
